I tried many of the autorestart plugins out there, but all I could find were either too complex or tick based. This means they where not accurate when TPS drops below 20 and therefore not compatible with plugins like [Hibernate](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hibernate.4441/) and [Server Naptime](https://github.com/gvk/MinecraftPluginServerHibernate).

So I decided to create my own.

## Features
- Schedule automatic restarts at a specific time.
- Warning messages broadcasted to players before restart.
- Realtime based and not tick based for more accurate.
- Compatible with plugins like [Hibernate](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/hibernate.4441/) and [Server Naptime](https://github.com/gvk/MinecraftPluginServerHibernate)
